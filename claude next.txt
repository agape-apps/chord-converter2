Using the input text:

{title: Amazing Grace}
{subtitle: Traditional}
[G]Amazing [D]grace how [G]sweet the [D]sound
That [G]saved a [D]wretch like [G]me
[G]I once was [D]lost but [G]now I'm [D]found
Was [G]blind but [D]now I [G]see

the output is showing only one word on one line at a time.

To help with debugging please add a debugging mode, where the unmodified output of the `HtmlFormatter` will be printed to the console. 

I suspect that adding a new line is part of the problem:
`const formattedContent = formatter.format(song).join('\n');`

The previously attached file songRendering.ts may also give some clues about the proper usage of `HtmlFormatter`.
